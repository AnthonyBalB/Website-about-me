        <h1>All My Pets</h1>
        <p> My first pet is my dog Xango. Xango is a pug that we got from a dog breeder when I still lived in Missouri. Xango is really old now, almost 12, and he loves to eat.</p>

        <p> Xango has never been the athetic dog since he's a pug and they're not known to be athletic, but the more you hang around him the more social he becomes.</p>
        
        <p> My next pet is my cat Lucca. Lucca is a siamese cat and was the last of her litter that was sold. We got Lucca as a Valentine's present in Missouri and she is almost 4 or 5.

            Lucca unlike Xango is not very social, but she does love attention.</p>
        
        <p> My last pet is my fish Bemo. Now this is a very odd story on how I got Bemo. I had three other fish before I had Bemo, and all of them, including Bemo, were all won from a carnival game. Most fish from carnival games don't even live for very long except Bemo because I won Bemo when I was in eighth grade which means that I had Bemo for two years, and he's a carnival fish.
